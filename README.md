Current status: All of set one and set two completed.
    Set three completed, with a catch. 23 is not working.
    Set four completed. 
    Set five completed - home stretch now!
    Set six completed!

Note: Challenge 48 does not work 100% of the time. There is some bug in the solution somewhere, which Im continuing to work on. But for the purposes of cracking RSA, its complete.
